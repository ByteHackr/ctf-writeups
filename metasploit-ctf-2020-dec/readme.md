# Metasploit CTF - December 2020

Player Name:  aquinas_nz
Team Name:    () { :;}; echo vulnerable

This is the first CTF for me where I have finished all the challenges and, as I came 9th out of ~1000, the first where I have one something. I also did this as a solo player rather than as a team, in contrast to all but two of the other top ten.

The final [scoreboard can be seen here](./Top 10 Teams.png). While the top 15 get the prizes, only the top ten show on the board. Lucky lucky :D
