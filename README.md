# CTF writeups

Write-ups of the vulnhub VMs, TryHackMe rooms and other CTFs I have done or am doing, plus helpful resources.

I maintain a list of useful scripts and commands (mainly shells etc) [here](./TIPS-AND-TRICKS.md). Note that this file will likely trigger the more active of virus scanners, like Windows Defender, who pick up on php webshells for example.

I also have a setup script I run on the TryHackMe attack box, which grabs some useful tools and wordlists for easy access. You can see this [here](./thm-setup.sh) (note the easy one line shell command to download it and run it).
